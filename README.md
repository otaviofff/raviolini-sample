# Raviolini Sample API

This sample API is built on top of Raviolini Framework. It's been configured to store domain objects on PostgreSQL, cache them on Redis, 
and log execution output in a dated file. Also, in order to setup this entire infrastructure effortlessly, this sample project also 
provides a Vagrantfile that, once executed, will rely on a Bootstrap file to provision all these nodes.
